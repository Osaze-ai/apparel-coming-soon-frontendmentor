## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**

## The challenge

To build this coming soon page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

## Built with

- Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

This project has challenged me to learn the basis of email validation and improve my understanding of css and JavaScript. I have learnt how to use the span tag instead of a div element for the h1 tag. 

html and css codes I'm proud of. 
```html
<h1>We're <br><span>coming <br>soon</span></h1>
```
```css
.container .left h1 span {
	color: hsl(0, 6%, 24%);
	font-weight: 700;
}
```
