### What I learned

This project has challenged me to learn the basis of email validation and improve my understanding of css and JavaScript. I have learnt how to use the span tag instead of a div element for the h1 tag. 

html and css codes I'm proud of. 
```html
<h1>We're <br><span>coming <br>soon</span></h1>
```
```css
.container .left h1 span {
	color: hsl(0, 6%, 24%);
	font-weight: 700;
}
```
